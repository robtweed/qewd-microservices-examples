# Notes

The API Handler Module directories contain two versions of the index.js files

- index.js: Version using QEWD-JSdb
- index.js.class: version using Cach&eacute;/IRIS Classes

If you want to use the Cach&eacute;/IRIS Classes versions, you must change the file name
from *index.js.class* to *index.js* when you copy them to your Windows system.

If you had already started the QEWD MicroService, you must stop and restart it to make use of
the renamed Cach&eacute;/IRIS Classes versions of the *index.js* files.
